                    During my sophomore year, while others built trendy AI projects, I was
                    still struggling with <code>if</code> and <code>for</code> statements.
                    It felt isolating ‚Äî but I refused to quit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I stepped back, practised pseudocode &amp; dry-runs, and began solving
                    LeetCode easies on my own. When&nbsp;
                    <i>Group Anagrams</i> finally clicked, I jumped on my bed in pure joy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This challenge is my way of sharpening the knife ‚Äî proving I can push
                    past every limit I once believed I had.
